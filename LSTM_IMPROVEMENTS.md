# LSTM Model Improvements for Music Generation

This document outlines the improvements made to the LSTM-based music generation model in the MusicAI-RBS-LSTM project.

## Overview of Improvements

The LSTM model has been significantly enhanced to produce more musically coherent and pleasing output. The improvements focus on:

1. **Model Architecture**
2. **Training Process**
3. **Music Generation Algorithm**
4. **Data Preparation and Augmentation**

## 1. Model Architecture Improvements

The LSTM model architecture has been enhanced with:

- **Bidirectional LSTM layers**: Allows the model to understand both past and future context in the music sequence
- **Deeper network**: Added more layers for better feature extraction and pattern recognition
- **Batch normalization**: Improves training stability and convergence
- **Increased model capacity**: More units in each layer to capture complex musical patterns
- **Improved regularization**: Strategic dropout to prevent overfitting

```python
def build_lstm_model(input_shape, output_dim):
    model = Sequential()
    
    # First bidirectional LSTM layer
    model.add(Bidirectional(LSTM(256, return_sequences=True), input_shape=input_shape))
    model.add(BatchNormalization())
    model.add(Dropout(0.3))
    
    # Second bidirectional LSTM layer
    model.add(Bidirectional(LSTM(256, return_sequences=True)))
    model.add(BatchNormalization())
    model.add(Dropout(0.3))
    
    # Third LSTM layer
    model.add(LSTM(256))
    model.add(BatchNormalization())
    model.add(Dropout(0.3))
    
    # Dense layers
    model.add(Dense(512, activation='relu'))
    model.add(BatchNormalization())
    model.add(Dropout(0.3))
    
    model.add(Dense(output_dim, activation='softmax'))
    
    # Use Adam optimizer with a configurable learning rate
    optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
    model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=optimizer, metrics=['accuracy'])
    
    return model
```

## 2. Training Process Improvements

The training process has been enhanced with:

- **Early stopping**: Prevents overfitting by monitoring validation loss
- **Learning rate scheduling**: Reduces learning rate when training plateaus
- **Validation split**: Properly evaluates model performance during training
- **Training history visualization**: Tracks and visualizes loss and accuracy
- **Improved batch size**: Better balance between learning speed and stability

```python
def train_lstm_model(model, X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=64, validation_split=0.1):
    # Define callbacks for better training
    callbacks = [
        # Early stopping to prevent overfitting
        EarlyStopping(
            monitor='val_loss',
            patience=10,
            restore_best_weights=True,
            verbose=1
        ),
        # Reduce learning rate when training plateaus
        ReduceLROnPlateau(
            monitor='val_loss',
            factor=0.5,
            patience=5,
            min_lr=1e-6,
            verbose=1
        )
    ]
    
    # Train with validation split and callbacks
    history = model.fit(
        X_train, y_train,
        epochs=epochs,
        batch_size=batch_size,
        validation_split=validation_split,
        callbacks=callbacks,
        verbose=1
    )
    
    return model, history
```

## 3. Music Generation Algorithm Improvements

The music generation algorithm has been significantly enhanced with:

- **Music theory integration**: Stronger adherence to key signatures and chord progressions
- **Phrase structure awareness**: Generates music with natural musical phrases
- **Melodic contour guidance**: Creates more natural melodic shapes (ascending/descending patterns)
- **Adaptive temperature sampling**: Adjusts randomness based on position in the phrase
- **Chord progression awareness**: Incorporates common chord progressions for the selected key
- **Repetition handling**: Intelligently manages note repetition for more natural sequences

Key improvements in the generation algorithm:

```python
# Define common chord progressions in the key
chord_progressions = {
    'C': ['C', 'G', 'Am', 'F'],  # I-V-vi-IV
    'G': ['G', 'D', 'Em', 'C'],  # I-V-vi-IV
    'D': ['D', 'A', 'Bm', 'G'],  # I-V-vi-IV
    # ... other keys
}

# Track phrase structure
phrase_length = 8  # Common musical phrase length
current_phrase_pos = 0

# Melodic contour guidance
# 0: neutral, 1: ascending, -1: descending
melodic_direction = 0

# Encourage melodic direction based on phrase position
if current_phrase_pos < phrase_length / 2:
    # First half of phrase - tend to ascend
    melodic_direction = 1
else:
    # Second half of phrase - tend to descend
    melodic_direction = -1
```

## 4. Data Preparation and Augmentation

The data preparation process has been enhanced with:

- **Data augmentation through transposition**: Creates more training examples by transposing existing sequences
- **Multi-instrument support**: Captures harmony information from multiple instrument parts
- **Enhanced note representation**: Includes duration and instrument information
- **Better error handling**: Robust parsing of MIDI files with error recovery
- **Progress tracking**: Visual feedback during the data preparation process

```python
def augment_data(notes, note_to_int, sequence_length):
    """
    Augment the dataset through transposition.
    
    This function creates additional training examples by transposing
    the original sequences up and down by 1-3 semitones.
    """
    # Transposition intervals (in semitones)
    transpositions = [-3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3]
    
    # Apply random transposition to create new training examples
    # ...
```

## Usage

To use the improved LSTM model:

1. **Test with existing weights**:
   ```
   python test_improved_lstm.py
   ```
   This will generate music using the improved algorithm with the existing trained weights.

2. **Train a new model** (requires significant computation time):
   ```
   python train_lstm.py
   ```
   This will train a new model with the improved architecture and training process.

## Results

The improved LSTM model produces more musically coherent output with:

- Better adherence to the selected key signature
- More natural melodic contours
- Improved phrase structure
- Enhanced harmonic consistency
- More varied and interesting musical patterns

The pitch distribution visualizations show how the model focuses on notes within the selected key, especially at lower temperature settings.

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for further enhancement:

1. **Transformer-based architecture**: Replace LSTM with a Transformer model for better long-range dependencies
2. **Style transfer**: Allow the model to generate music in the style of specific composers
3. **Conditional generation**: Generate music based on specific conditions (mood, genre, etc.)
4. **Interactive generation**: Allow real-time interaction with the generation process
5. **Multi-track generation**: Generate multiple instrument tracks simultaneously with proper coordination
